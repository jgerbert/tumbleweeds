## Project Structure

1. **index.html**: The main HTML file that includes the canvas element for the game, and the required script tags for Matter.js and the game logic.

2. **main.js**: The entry point of the game, responsible for initializing the game world, controllers, and views. It sets up the game loop and handles game updates and rendering.

3. **gameStage.js**: The game world class, responsible for creating and managing the Matter.js physics world, as well as creating game objects like paddles and tumbleweed.

4. **gameStageView.js**: The world view class, responsible for rendering the game world and its objects on the canvas.

5. **GameController.js**: The game controller class, responsible for managing the game state, handling game events, updating player scores, and managing the game world.

6. **InputController.js**: The input controller class, responsible for handling player input from mouse, touch, and keyboard events. It includes methods for controlling the paddles and interacting with tumbleweed.

7. **Tumbleweed.js**: The tumbleweed model class, representing a tumbleweed object in the game world. It includes properties and methods related to the tumbleweed's physics body, size, position, and initial velocity.

8. **Paddle.js**: The paddle model class, representing a paddle object in the game world. It includes properties and methods related to the paddle's physics body, size, position, and movement.

9. **Player.js**: The player model class, representing a game player. It includes properties for the player's score and serving status, as well as methods for adding points and toggling serving.


## Code Structure

The code structure is organized into **models**, **views**, and **controllers**. The models (`Tumbleweed.js`, `Paddle.js`, and `Player.js`) represent the game objects and their properties. The views (`WorldView.js` and `TumbleweedView.js`) are responsible for rendering the game objects on the canvas. The controllers (`GameController.js` and `InputController.js`) manage the game state and handle player input.

The game uses **Matter.js**, a 2D physics engine, for managing the physics world and the interactions between game objects. The code is modular and organized in a way that makes it easy to understand and extend. The use of classes and methods, as well as proper naming conventions, ensures that the code is easy to read and maintain.

- Single player and two player modes
- Customizable game settings such as paddle size, ball speed, and game score limit
- Pause, resume, and restart functionality

## Wish List
  - Powerups
    - Speed: increases the velocity of the ball by 20%.
    - Sticky: when the ball collides with the paddle, the ball remains stuck to the paddle unless the spacebar is pressed again. This allows the player to better position the ball before releasing it.
    - Pass-Through: collision resolution is disabled for non-solid blocks, allowing the ball to pass through multiple blocks.
    - Pad-Size-Increase: increases the width of the paddle by 50 pixels.
    - Confuse: activates the confuse postprocessing effect for a short period of time, confusing the user.
    - Chaos: activates the chaos postprocessing effect for a short period of time, heavily disorienting the user.
    - Slingshot

    Here are a few thoughts on animation illusions that can be used in video games:

Squash and stretch - Exaggerating the squashing and stretching of objects can make motions seem more dynamic. For example, when a character jumps, you may squash them down as they crouch and then stretch them upwards as they spring up. This exaggeration of the motion makes it seem more alive.
Anticipation - Before a major action, animating a wind up or anticipation can add appeal and weight to the motion. For example, a character may lean back or swing their arms backwards before throwing a punch or jumping.
Secondary motion - Adding extra secondary motions in addition to the primary action can make animations seem more realistic. For example, having a character's clothes or hair move after they stop running, or jiggling/bouncing effects after an impact.
Slow in and slow out - Animating objects to speed up and slow down gradually at the starts and ends of motions makes the movement seem less robotic. This ease in and ease out gives a more natural, appealing feel.
Exaggerated physics - Exaggerating physics effects like gravity, momentum, and inertia can give more life to motions. For example, elongating the floaty hang time on a character's jump before gravity pulls them down.
Particle effects - Using particle effects like trails, dust clouds and debris adds extra flair to things like running, jumping and impacts for added dynamism.
Overlapping action - Having different parts of a character or object move at slightly different rates creates a more complex, organic look to animation. For example, having a character's arms and legs move at different rates when running.
The key is to push the exaggeration and secondary motion to add appeal, weight and dynamism to key actions the player sees often. Clever illusions can bring limited animations to life.
